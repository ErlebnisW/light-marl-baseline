# MAPPO in MPE environment
This is a concise Pytorch implementation of MAPPO in MPE environment( the multi-agent particle-world environment).<br />
This code only works in environments where all agents are homogenous, such as 'Spread' in MPE. Here, all agents have the same dimension of observation space and action space.<br />

## How to use my code?
You can dircetly run 'MAPPO_main.py' in your own IDE.<br />

## Trainning environments
We train our MAPPO in 'simple_spread' in MPE environment.
